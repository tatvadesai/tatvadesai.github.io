There are 2 types of people broadly speaking: Innovators and Allocators. Innovators and Allocators need each other to survive. They are perfectly complement to each other. Innovators make the world that we live in, the gadgets to infra to anything new that can be forged in reality. Allocators are the enablers of Innovators.

Allocators and Innovators both optimise the use of their resources. Innovators generally optimise under the apprentice of lady Physics whereas Allocators optimise capital. Capital comes in many forms - Human, Social, Economic, and more.

But how can you identify which category you fall into? It's not always clear-cut, but there are telltale signs. Innovators are often driven by an insatiable curiosity, constantly tinkering and questioning the status quo. They're the ones who ask "what if?" and "why not?" Allocators, on the other hand, excel at recognizing potential and directing resources to maximize impact. They're the ones who ask "how can we make this work?" and "where can we best invest our efforts?"

Steve Jobs and Jony Ive represent a powerful Innovator-Allocator duo in the tech world. Jobs, the visionary Innovator, had an uncanny ability to anticipate consumer desires before they even knew them. Ive, often overlooked in popular narratives, was not just a designer but an Allocator of aesthetic and functional resources. He translated Jobs' grand visions into tangible, revolutionary products, optimizing every curve, material, and user interaction.

In the world of commodities trading, Marc Rich and Pincus Green formed a formidable partnership. Rich, the Innovator, revolutionized the oil trade by creating the spot market for crude oil. Green, the master Allocator, expertly managed the complex logistics and financial intricacies of their global operations.

The entertainment industry saw a powerful Innovator-Allocator dynamic in Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer.

In the diamond industry, Savjibhai Dholakia and Govindbhai Dholakia present an intriguing case. This doesnâ€™t fit into our Innovator and Allocator premise but they sure are a noteworthy example.



This dynamic bears a striking resemblance to evolutionary theory. In nature, we see a constant interplay between mutation (innovation) and selection (allocation). New traits emerge randomly, but it's the environment that determines which ones thrive. Similarly, Innovators generate a multitude of ideas, while Allocators help determine which ones will flourish in the marketplace of reality.

History is full of stories of Innovators and Allocators creating incredible value through collaboration. Dhirubhai Ambani stands out as a rare individual who embodied both Innovator and Allocator traits. As an Innovator, he revolutionized India's textile industry and later disrupted the telecom sector. As an Allocator, he masterfully navigated India's complex regulatory environment, channeling resources to build Reliance Industries into a conglomerate. His ability to both innovate and allocate at scale created a business empire that is still reshaping India's Economy.

Venture capitalists (VCs) represent a fascinating subset of Allocators, playing a meta-game in the innovation ecosystem. They're not just allocating capital to individual companies, but shaping entire industries and technological trajectories. By choosing which ideas to fund, VCs are effectively betting on and influencing the future. This role requires a unique blend of foresight, risk assessment, and the ability to nurture nascent innovations.

The apparent imbalance - why more people try to be Allocators than Innovators - can be explained by redundancy as a feature. Innovation is inherently risky, with a high failure rate. For every successful Innovator, there are countless others whose ideas never gain traction. Allocation, while still challenging, offers more predictable paths to success and the ability to spread risk across multiple investments. This redundancy in the system ensures that resources are available when truly groundbreaking innovations emerge.

A superhuman ability emerges when one person possesses the characteristics of both Innovators and Allocators. This rare combination allows for a seamless integration of vision and execution, innovation and optimization. These individuals can simultaneously dream big and execute with precision, understanding both the creative and practical aspects of bringing ideas to fruition. They can envision breakthrough technologies or business models while also grasping the intricate details of implementation, from supply chain logistics to market positioning.

This dual capability often results in exponential success, as there's no loss of fidelity between the innovative idea and its execution. It allows for rapid iteration and pivoting, as the individual can quickly assess both the creative potential and practical viability of new directions.

A good maxim can be formed: Innovate or Allocate. Limited to constraints of Biology and Physics.

We can theorise all about the characteristics, qualities and personalities but it all comes down to one thing: Progress.

If we dig deeper, it comes down to the speed of the progress.
