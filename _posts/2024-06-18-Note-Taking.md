### Why?

I read a lot and although my brain can retain quite a good amount of information, having a system to store it somewhere seems like a good idea as the consumption will increase steadily.


I use Notion and Obsidian to take notes. Roughly "brain-dump" is Obsidian and "Good-Notes" is in Notion. There is a Dashboard and Library in Notion that is going well. Well, obsidian is a mine and I just have to polish the contents there to convert it to Diamond.


Here's the Library:

This is so accessible. But I have to find a way to get this in Obsidian.


Also, I have backed up the Obsidian Vault to Git that just makes it secure. Trust me, I have lost all of my notion data once. I don't want that to happen again.




This is exactly what tinkering around means. I am also exploring the plugins available in Obsidian. I have a good feeling that those are gonna be exquisite.
