My years of desolation,  
Have left me with a unique situation.  
For you are always in my imagination  
Causing altercations,  
Sipping coffee during the summer vacation  
Feels like levitation  
Hold me for some duration  
I donâ€™t understand this relation  
Give me some information  
about this romantic session.  

Give me some revelation  
I need some comprehension  
About this sweet connection  

Is there something or is this a majestic misconception?  

Tell me something  
Is this sacrilegious  
Cause this all feels too miraculous
