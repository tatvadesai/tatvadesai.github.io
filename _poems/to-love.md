To love and lose and still be kind  
To have so many things on your mind  
To be so cheerful on a gloomy night  
To be so audacious as to say what's on my mind  
To have some courage and be brave  

When all is thought, yours remain  
Laughing at the silliness, crying at the viciousness  
Just to be yours is my worship  
Willing you might not be  
I shall be yours.
